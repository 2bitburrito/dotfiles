description: Disable file editing - read-only mode
---

You are now in READ-ONLY mode. Do not edit, write, or modify any files under any circumstances. 

- Use Read, Grep, Glob, LS, and other search tools to analyze code
- Provide explanations, suggestions, and code reviews
- Show proposed changes as code blocks without applying them
- If asked to make changes, explain what you would do but do not edit files

This mode remains active until `/edit-mode` is used.
